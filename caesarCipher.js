// A caesarCipher function that takes a string and a shift factor
// and returns it with each character “shifted”. Read more about how a Caesar cipher works.

// Don’t forget to test wrapping from z to a. For example, caesarCipher('xyz', 3) should return 'abc'.

// Don’t forget to test case preservation. The shifted lettercase should follow the original lettercase.
// For example, caesarCipher('HeLLo', 3) should return 'KhOOr'.

// Don’t forget to test punctuation. Punctuation, spaces, and other non-alphabetical characters should
// remain unchanged. For example, caesarCipher('Hello, World!', 3) should return 'Khoor, Zruog!'.

// For this one, you may want to split the final function into a few smaller functions.
// One concept of Testing is that you don’t need to explicitly test every function you write…
// Just the public ones. So in this case you only need tests for the final caesarCipher function.
// If it works as expected you can rest assured that your smaller helper functions are doing what they’re supposed to.
